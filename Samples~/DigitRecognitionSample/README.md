## Sample Setup

- In the sample folder, under `Models`, click on `mnist-21`.
- In the Inspector, click `Serialize To StreamingAssets`.

The main script in this sample is `DigitRecognition.cs`, which requires a reference to the MNIST-21 model.
If you change the path to the model, remember to change it in all `DigitRecognition.cs` scripts.

### Package Dependencies

This sample requires the Unity Sentis package (`com.unity.sentis`) and was built with version 2.1.2 of the package.
